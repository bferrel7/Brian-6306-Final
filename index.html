      <h4 style="color:white">Hubway</h4>
      <p style="color:white">The Bostonbikes program was founded in 2007, and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council joined due to the need for the service to span town boundaries. Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville joined Boston to bring the service to their communities as well. Hubway began as a bike share platform that was launched in 2011 with 600 bicycles and 60 stations. Brookline, Cambridge, and Somerville launched stations in 2012, and Hubway rides continued to grow exponentially. By 2014, Hubway had around 10,00 annual memberships and had sold 79,000 Day Passes, 9,000 3-Day Passes, and 2,000 Monthly Memberships in the previous year. From 2015 to 2016, Hubway expanded to more neighborhoods in Boston and Cambridge. Before Hubway’s rebranding to Bluebikes, the system had expanded to include 185 stations with 600 bicycles.

      <h3>Expansion and Transformation</h3>
      <h4>How?</h4>
      <p>In 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts sponsored the bike share system and changed the name to BlueBikes. The expansion was set to bring the number of bikes to 3000 and increase the number of stations by 100.</p>
      <p>Our Research is focusing on the transition from Hubway to BlueBikes and the expansion of the system into the surrounding areas of Boston. When the service was expanded, more residential areas gained access to stations, which provided more residents access to the service as a first-mile solution in their commute. We are analyzing trip data from 2017 before the expansion/ transition to BlueBikes and comparing data from 2019 after the expansion.This project investigates the strategies that the service is using in its expansion and the characteristics of the neighborhoods that the expansion affects.</p>

      <h3 style="color:white">Conclusion</h3>
      <p style="color:white">Boston’s transition from Hubway to BlueBikes has brought expanded transportation options to multiple new neighborhoods in the surrounding areas. When Hubway began the system, the goal was to provide a mostly short-term service to serve tourists and visitors to Boston. With the subsequent expansions, the service expanded into more residential areas to give local citizens more access to the service as a long term membership, providing options like income eligible membership pricing. This resulted in higher levels of long-term membership among residents. Overall, the system saw increases in total trips vs miles traveled and the total number of trips per year.
